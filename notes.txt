Current State:

- Transparent header with labelled buttons of the following: about, home, resumé and contact. 
- Bootstrap and materialize referenced in the HTML head (see index.html). 
- Constolas equivalent font provided by Google. 
- Public GitHub repository to be used for uploading back-ups to access on PC via laptop/sharing with others. 

Priorities:

Create a StackOverflow account. 
Grasp a better understanding of HTML in comparison to what you already knew. [ ☑️ ]
Consider installing the Reddit mobile app to join IT and code related subreddits. You never know when you will need it. 
Frequent updating to the site itself, as well as the Git repository. Keeps things fresh and easily accessible from laptop-PC transitions. 
Notify @SOCIAL PINGS, keep those interested in the loop of what you are doing. [ ☑️ ]

Other:

Transparent header with buttons. [ ☑️ ]
Discord server integration. [ ☑️ ]
Sticky footer using Materialize. 
Dark/Light mode toggle. Difficult, maybe, but this feature is bound to blow a few minds. 
Create a mailing list to notify those who sign-up about updates, early-access, downtime etc. 
Smooth transition effects using JS or node.js.
Mobile and tablet/iPad friendly GUI adaptations. This will need to be looked into, but I did notice something related to this on Materialize.
